What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git sub-directory is created to house all the meta-data required for 
git to track the files in the directory.

You need to do it before performing commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It contains files that will be included in the next commit.  It allows the user to
pick and choose a logical subset of the working directory files for the next commit.
