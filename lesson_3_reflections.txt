When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when working remotely away from your main computer
- when working on multi-person projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because it may introduce conflicts with your local copies.
